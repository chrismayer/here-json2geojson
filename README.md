# HERE JSON to GeoJSON

JavaScript library to transform HERE JSON objects to GeoJSON.

At the moment only a subset of the JSON response types provided by the [HERE REST APIs](https://developer.here.com/api-explorer/rest) is supported. This will be extended from time to time.


#### Disclaimer

**This is not an official HERE product!**

Be sure to respect the [HERE Service Terms](https://legal.here.com/en/terms/serviceterms/us/) when using their API.

## Usage

To use this library in an HTML-web-application just include the JavaScript-file at ``dist/hj2gj.js`` into your HTML-page. Otherwise just import this library as module like in the snippet below:

```JavaScript
import {readIsolines} from 'here-json2geojson';

var hereIsolineResponse = // The response of the HERE REST API call
var isolineFeatColl = readIsolines(hereIsolineResponse);
```

### Build the library on your own

```
> npm install
> npm run dist
```

Afterwards the single-file-build of the library is available under ``dist/hj2gj.js``
